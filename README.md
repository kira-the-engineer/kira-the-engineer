Howdy!! I'm Kira and I'm currently an undergraduate student at Oregon State University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.

My focus areas are in robotics and microcontroller/embedded systems design. I prefer to work with lower level software such as embedded C, but I also have a wealth of experience in higher level languages as well. I've previously interned at NASA JPL and Tektronix and I was previously the team lead for
the OSURC Mars Rover team!

Most of my repositories are currently hidden, but I plan on making them public once I graduate/finish the classes they pertain to.
